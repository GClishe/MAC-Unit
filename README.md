# MAC-Unit
SystemVerilog implementation of MAC Unit for matrix multiplication.

This repo will contain a simple SystemVerilog implementation of a MAC unit and a higher-level matrix multiplication design intended for synthesis and implementation on a basys3 FPGA. 

Matrices that will be multiplied are listed in row-major order in mem/, and are stored in FPGA ROM.
